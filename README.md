# Computer-Vision

mage classification using CNNs in Keras

# Data Description:

You are provided with a training set and a test set of images of plant seedlings at various stages of grown. Each image has a filename that is its unique id. The dataset comprises 12 plant species. The goal of the competition is to create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from a photo.

# Dataset:

The project is from a dataset from Kaggle.
